## Welcome to ManyDeps

This project aggregates several C/C++ dependencies built for linux and windows.
We all know that it is **currently very hard** to build with dependencies on C/C++... but we think this set of projects can help!

This is meant for **learning** purposes, so feel free to contribute if you find this helpful!

- If you want to build with GNU gmp, see [manydeps-gmp](https://github.com/manydeps/manydeps-gmp)
   * [![CMake on Multiple Platforms](https://github.com/manydeps/manydeps-gmp/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manydeps/manydeps-gmp/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml)
- If you want to build CLN (from GINAC project) with GNU gmp, see [manydeps-cln](https://github.com/manydeps/manydeps-cln)

Project organized by [prof. Igor Machado Coelho](https://github.com/igormcoelho).
